To add an envelope to the `Retrieve Citizen Income` stub to return a failure response, use a `curl` request like the following:

    curl -XPOST \
      "http://localhost:9359/seed/individuals/AB216913B/income?status=503&description=Service+unavailable"

A call to the `Retrieve Citizen Income` stub endpoint will be made by the application in the following way:

    curl -v -XPOST \
    -H "Content-type: application/json" \
    -d '{"fromDate": "2016-12-31", "toDate": "2017-12-31", "surname": "Surname","firstName": "FirstName","gender": "M","initials": "F S","dateOfBirth": "2000-03-29"}' \
    http://localhost:9359/individuals/AB216913B/income

> Note: the `Nino` (AB216913B) in the url have no effect on the response, it will always return the active profile.
